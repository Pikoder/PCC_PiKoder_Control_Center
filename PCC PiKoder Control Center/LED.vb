    ' This control is an LED indicator control that can be placed on a form
    ' to simulate an actual LED. The display indicator is painted as a round
    ' image using direct drawing commands instead of the more common LED implementations
    ' using bitmap images. The indicator image includes a 3D border and a reflection
    ' glint to give the appearance of realism to the control. Through the use of the
    ' graphic drawing algorithm used the LED can be set to almost any practical size
    ' at design time from a few pixels across to few hundred pixels, although the
    ' realism look of the indicator start to degrade after the control is sized over
    ' about 50 or 60 pizels. (The ability to size the LED was a key motivator to design
    ' and build this control as other sample controls from the WEB are fixed size and
    ' many times too small for display screens with a high density pixels/inch setting.
    '
    ' This control supports four property settings all of which are read/write at both
    ' design time and run time. The properties are:
    '
    '   LED.State As Boolean                Controls the LED On/Off state. True = On while
    '                                       False = Off. (Note that this state is a higher
    '                                       state over the Blink states on.off that flashes
    '                                       the image.
    '
    '   LED.Blink As Boolean                This controls whether the LED will blink when it
    '                                       is in the On state. An LED can have its blink state
    '                                       set on even though the LED may be actually off via
    '                                       the State property. True = Blink enabled while
    '                                       False = no blink.
    '
    '   LED.Interval As Integer             This property specifies the blink rate interval for
    '                                       the LED in nominal units of milliseconds. Note that
    '                                       this property value is utilized directly by a standard
    '                                       timer and as such has similar granualrity and resolution
    '                                       behavior that a normal timer control will have. Practical
    '                                       values for the interval parameter are from 50 to 1000.
    '                                       At 1000 the LED blinks off for 1 second and then on for
    '                                       1 second.
    '
    '   LED.Color As LEDColorSelection      This property specifies the color for the LED. The values
    '                                       are specified by as Public enumeration value in the control.
    '                                       The selection values are:
    '
    '                                               0 - LED_Red
    '                                               1 - LED_Green
    '                                               2 - LED_Yellow
    '                                               3 - LED_Blue
